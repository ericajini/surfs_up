## Overview of Analysis: 

The overall goal of this project was to create a weather analysis for the island of Oahu to determine if a Surf and Shake shop would be a viable business that could be sustained year round. Prior to this specific part of the analysis, I created a Flask app investors could run to easily access the weather data on their own.

For this part of the analysis I focused on the weather trends during the middle and end of the year (over multiple years) to see if the weather was not only good in the summer, but also good towards the end of the year in the winter too. During the last part of the analysis I also created a review for the other 2 quarters in the year and included percipitaion in all 4 quarters. This will be discussed more in the summary section.  

## Results

1. When looking at the temperatures for June, the mean (74.94) and the median (75) are very close meaning there is a symmetrical distribution. The temperatures are also very consistent throughout the month with there only being a 4 degree difference between the 3rd and 1st quartile.

2. When looking at the temperatures for December, the mean (71.04) and the median (71) are very close meaning there is a symmetrical distribution. The temperatures also seem consistent throughout the month with there only being a 5 degree difference between the 3rd and the 1st quartile, but less consistent than June. The min temperature is 56 degrees in Dec which is 8 degrees colder than the min in June, but you are still seeing max temperatures within 2 degrees and only a 3 degree difference between the average day. With that said, factoring in temperature alone, I think the Surf and Shake shop would be viable year round.

3. There does not appear to be too much rain within the month of June with 75 % of the data falling within .12 inches and 50 % of the data falling within .02 inches. For December 75% of the data falls within .15 inches and 50 % of the data falling within .03 inches. Both months are very comparable to each other in terms of percipitaion and I don't think this is a factor that would impact the viability of the shop. 

## Summary 

Based on the 2 months reviewed above, I would say Oahu is a great place to have a Surf and Shake shop. With that said though, after completing the review above, I was curious how the other parts of the year looked too so that we have a more holistic view to determine if the shop is viable. I also wanted to include percipitation in with the review to make sure this was not a factor that would impact the shop (I did go back and add percipitation to the 2 months reviewed above after wanting to do the same thing for the other 2 quarters in the year). 

### Additional Review 

1. When looking at the temperatures for March, the mean (70.6) and the median (70) are very close meaning there is a symmetrical distribution. The temperatures are also very consistent throughout the month with there only being a 5 degree difference between the 3rd and 1st quartile. There does not appear to be too much rain within the month of March with 75 % of the data falling within .12 inches and 50 % of the data falling within .01 inches.

2. When looking at the temperatures for September, the mean (70.5) and the median (70) are very close meaning there is a symmetrical distribution. The temperatures are also very consistent throughout the month with there only being a 5 degree difference between the 3rd and 1st quartile. There does not appear to be too much rain within the month of March with 75 % of the data falling within .12 inches and 50 % of the data falling within .01 inches.

### Final Summary 

Overall, after looking at all 4 quarters of the year, I come to the same conclusion that Oahu is a great place to open a Surf and Shake shop. The temperatures are pretty consistent throughout the year and there does not appear to be much rain that will impact business on most days.
